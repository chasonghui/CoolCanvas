## Canvas
Canvas and Video practice

By overlaying the canvas on the physics experiment video, the xy axis is set and the coordinates are transformed according to the set origin. 
The x-axis length is received as an input and the coordinates are transformed according to the input value.
If you enter the analysis mode and click the canvas, the frame is automatically moved, and thencoordinates of the clicked place can be saved and checked as a table.
